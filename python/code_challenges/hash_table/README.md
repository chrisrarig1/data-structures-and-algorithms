# Hash Tables

Features
Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:

- set
    - Arguments: key, value
    - Returns: nothing
- get
    - Arguments: key
    - Returns: Value associated with that key in the table
- contains
    - Arguments: key
    - Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
- keys
    - Returns: Collection of keys
- hash
    - Arguments: key
    - Returns: Index in the collection for that key

## Approach

- Using a lot of logic from linked lists I developed methods based off of Node structure
